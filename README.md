## About me:

Here you will be able to see the projects that I have realized along my computer science journey; most of them have been imported from other environments, as I did not master Git at the time I developed them, or they were developed in my school's environment.

- :books: I am learning advanced probabilities and statistics for machine learning purposes and applications to finance.
- 🎯 I am currently looking for a 6 to 12 month intership/contract from July 2026 to June 2027 to work as a quantitative-reasercher within the financial industry or as a data-scientist/AI researcher in the tech-industry.
- :raised_hand: Ask me about anything you want to know more about on my profile and my displayed projects.
- :email: To contact me, you can find my LinkedIn and my email on my profile; choose whichever you prefer!

Here you will find my English [resume](resume.pdf).
